Casa.el is a package for managing dotfiles with Emacs and Org Mode.

* How it works?

Casa.el is simple. It's hardly any code because it leverages the power of Emacs, Org-Mode, and Git. 

Your dotfiles live as .org files in a git repo in the ~.config/dotfiles~ directory (by default). Your home directory is set up to be a Git Worktree of that dotfiles repo with an "orphan" (empty in Git parlance) branch named after the host name.

To update your dotfiles, you edit the appropriate Org file. Once you're happy with the changes, you run the =casa-deploy= command which will tangle all the org files into your home directory and commit the changes to the worktree. The result is that you have a "main" branch of your repo with all your dotfiles and a branch for each machine with the "tangled" or compiled output.
